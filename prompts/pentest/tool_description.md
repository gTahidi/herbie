The pentesting tools provide capabilities for security testing and exploitation:

1. Privilege Escalation Tool:
   - System enumeration
   - Vulnerability discovery
   - Exploit attempts
   - Docker-based isolation

2. Web Testing Tool:
   - Web scanning
   - Endpoint testing
   - Parameter fuzzing
   - Async HTTP requests

Usage:
1. For privilege escalation:
   ```python
   response = await agent.execute_tool("privesc", {
       "action": "enumerate",
       "target": "172.17.0.2"
   })
   ```

2. For web testing:
   ```python
   response = await agent.execute_tool("web_test", {
       "action": "scan",
       "target": "http://example.com",
       "scan_type": "full"
   })
   ```

Note: These tools should only be used on systems you have explicit permission to test.
